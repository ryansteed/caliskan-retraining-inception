This folder contains 300 faces, all with different identities. The faces were generated with FaceGen Modeller 3.1 (Singular Inversions, 2004), as described in Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008. The faces are bald Caucasian males and females.

The file names begin with "f42887_e_" to identify them as belonging to the same set. Following this sequence, each individual face is given a number from 000 to 299 to distinguish it from other faces in the set.

Data: The average ratings for the 300 faces on all 9 traits are organized in an Excel spreadsheet. The first column contains the face name, the rest contain mean ratings (average of all participants' ratings) on a scale from 1 (not at all [trait]) to 9 (extremely [trait]). We have also added gender information as of July 30th, 2014. The next to last column in the spreadsheet indicates the proportion of participants who classified the face as female, and the last column indicates our classification of each face into a gender category based on the empirical ratings from participants.
